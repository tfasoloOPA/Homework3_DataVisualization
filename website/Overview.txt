1. Custom Color Scheme: The website's original color palette has been replaced with a new theme featuring a deep red gradient for the navigation and hero sections, and vibrant blue for headings and accents, creating a more dynamic and personalized visual identity.

2. Custom Typography and Spacing: I adjusted the typography by setting specific font sizes, weights, and letter-spacing for headings and paragraphs, and also modified the line-height and margins to improve readability and create a more balanced and professional layout.

3. Custom Layout and Image Sizing: The layout was customized using Flexbox for the navigation bar and Grid for the about section to structure content, and I specifically adjusted the project image to be 40% of its container's width and centered it on the page for a more focused presentation.

4. Interactive Hover Effects: To enhance user experience, I added interactive hover effects, such as a subtle upward transform on navigation links and a zoom effect on images, providing visual feedback and making the site feel more responsive to a more engaging interface.
