                          This photograph captures the moment waves collide with a rugged rock outcrop from a high vantage point. I was drawn to the contrast between deep teal water and bright sea foam, and composed the frame so the central rock anchors the energy of the surf while the foreground greenery adds depth and a natural vignette.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To freeze the motion and keep the textures crisp, I used a fast shutter speed and a mid-range aperture for balanced sharpness. Shooting from above compresses the shoreline into graphic shapes and patterns, guiding the eye from the foamy edges toward the rock at center.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In post, I processed the RAW file in Lightroom to recover highlight detail in the foam, lift shadow texture in the stone, and refine white balance for a clean, natural aqua. Subtle dodge-and-burn in Photoshop helped shape the light and remove minor distractions without over-processing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This image reflects my landscape approach: clean composition, disciplined exposure, and restrained color grading that respects the scene. It stands on its own as a fine-art print and serves as a strong hero visual for web or editorial layouts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The final deliverable preserves fine detail in water and rock, with balanced contrast and true-to-life color. It reproduces cleanly in print and is optimized for the web, demonstrating my end-to-end workflow—from on-location scouting and capture to thoughtful post-production.
