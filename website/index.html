                            Hello! My name is Thiago Fasolo, and I am a passionate photographer and videographer from Greenville, SC. Originally born and raised in Brazil, I fell in love with capturing moments at a young age. I was always fascinated by freezing moments in time forever. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, I specialize in portrait, event, and short-form commercial work that blends cinematic storytelling with natural light. Whether I’m documenting families, seniors, or small businesses, my goal is the same: to reveal genuine emotion. I plan, shoot, and edit with intention so every frame feels honest, vibrant, and memorable for every client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rooted in my Brazilian heritage and shaped by Greenville’s creative community, I bring warmth, rhythm, and discipline to every project. I’m bilingual in English and Portuguese and comfortable on fast-paced sets. Clients appreciate my clear communication, punctuality, and collaborative approach from pre-production to the final cut, delivered on schedule every single time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From concept decks to color grading, I handle the full process or plug into your team where needed. Let’s create content that elevates your brand, preserves your family’s story, or energizes your event. Reach out to chat ideas, timelines, and packages—I’ll bring the cameras, you bring your vision. Let’s make something unforgettable.
